Let me analyze the codebase to identify what files and components are missing to make this a fully functional application, based on the README's mention of exempt content.

Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can identify the key missing components that would be needed to make this a fully functional tax filing application. The README explicitly states that certain sensitive components have been intentionally removed or rewritten due to security restrictions.

## üîí **Missing Components for Full Functionality**

### **1. Authentication & Identity Management (SADI Integration)**
**Status:** Partially stubbed/missing

The frontend references SADI (likely the IRS's authentication system) but the actual implementation is missing:
- `VITE_SADI_AUTH_ID` - Authentication identifier
- `VITE_SADI_XFF_HEADER` - X-Forwarded-For header for IP tracking  
- `VITE_SADI_TID_HEADER` - Transaction ID header
- `VITE_SADI_LOGOUT_URL` - Logout endpoint
- **Real authentication provider integration** - Currently uses placeholder/mock authentication

### **2. MeF (Modernized e-File) Integration**
**Status:** Heavily stubbed with SDK references missing

The MeF integration is the core of tax submission but is largely incomplete:
- **MeF SDK/Client Libraries** - References to `gov.irs.mef.*` packages exist but implementation is missing
- **MeF Keystore & Certificates** - The submit service requires:
  ```bash
  SUBMIT_KEYSTORE_KEYSTOREBASE64="[base64-encoded-keystore]"
  SUBMIT_KEYSTORE_KEYSTOREPASSWORD="[keystore-password]"  
  SUBMIT_KEYSTORE_KEYSTOREALIAS="[keystore-alias]"
  ```
- **MeF Connection Parameters:**
  ```bash
  SUBMIT_ASID="[submit-asid]"      # Application Service ID
  SUBMIT_EFIN="[submit-efin]"      # Electronic Filing ID Number
  SUBMIT_ETIN="[submit-etin]"      # Electronic Transmitter ID Number
  ```
- **MeF Client Configuration** - Real endpoint URLs and connection settings

### **3. Cryptographic Components**
**Status:** Encryption framework exists but keys/secrets are missing

- **LOCAL_WRAPPING_KEY** - AES encryption key for sensitive data
- **AWS KMS Integration** - Real KMS keys for production encryption
- **TLS/SSL Certificates** - For secure communications
- **JWT Signing Keys** - For state API authentication

### **4. Production Configuration Files**
**Status:** Development configs exist, production missing

Missing application property files:
- **Production `application.yaml`** for each service
- **Environment-specific configurations** (staging, prod)
- Database connection strings for production
- AWS service configurations (real endpoints, regions, credentials)

### **5. Tax Logic & Fact Dictionary**
**Status:** Core framework exists, some logic may be simplified

The fact graph system is present but may be missing:
- **Complete tax calculation logic** - Some complex scenarios might be simplified
- **All tax forms support** - References suggest more forms than what's visible
- **State-specific tax rules** - Varies by jurisdiction

### **6. Data Import Services**
**Status:** Framework exists, real IRS data connections missing

- **IRS Data Retrieval APIs** - For importing taxpayer W-2s, 1099s, etc.
- **Third-party integrations** - Banks, employers, financial institutions
- **Real taxpayer data validation** - SSN validation, identity verification

### **7. Production Infrastructure Components**

**Database Schemas & Migrations:**
- Production-ready database schemas
- Data retention/archival policies
- Backup and recovery procedures

**AWS Infrastructure:**
- Real AWS service configurations (not LocalStack)
- Production S3 buckets, SQS queues, SNS topics
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- VPC and security group configurations

**Load Balancing & CDN:**
- Application load balancer configurations
- CloudFront distributions
- Geographic routing for different regions

### **8. Monitoring & Observability**
**Status:** Framework exists, real endpoints missing

- **Production logging endpoints**
- **Real monitoring dashboards** (beyond local Grafana)
- **Alert configurations**
- **Performance monitoring**

### **9. Content & Localization**
**Status:** Structure exists, some content may be placeholder

- **Complete translations** for Spanish
- **Legal disclaimers and terms**
- **Help content and documentation**
- **Error message libraries**

### **10. Testing & Validation Data**
**Status:** Test scenarios exist, real validation missing

- **Complete test scenario coverage**
- **Production-equivalent test data**
- **End-to-end integration tests** with real services

## üõ†Ô∏è **To Make It Functional for Development:**

1. **Set up authentication mocks** - Create fake SADI responses
2. **Configure MeF stubs** - Use the existing offline mode with fake responses
3. **Generate development certificates** - Create self-signed certs for testing
4. **Set environment variables** - Use the test values mentioned in documentation
5. **Use LocalStack** - Already configured for AWS service simulation
6. **Add fact dictionary content** - The framework exists, just needs complete tax logic

## üéØ **Priority for Basic Functionality:**

1. **Authentication system** (even if mocked)
2. **MeF integration** (can work in offline mode)
3. **Encryption keys** (can use development keys)
4. **Complete fact dictionary** (tax calculation logic)
5. **Database migrations** (already mostly present)

The codebase is remarkably complete for an open-source release - the architecture and most implementation details are intact. The missing pieces are primarily the sensitive integration points and production-specific configurations that you'd expect to be excluded from a public repository of a government tax system.
