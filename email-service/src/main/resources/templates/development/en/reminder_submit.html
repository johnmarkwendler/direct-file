                  Remember, even if you have an extension to file your taxes,
                  you still need to pay your taxes by the due date to avoid
                  penalties.

                <h2>Don't forget about state taxes and credits</h2>
                <p>
                  Depending on your situation, you may have to file a state tax
                  return in addition to a federal tax return. You may also be
                  eligible for state tax credits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keep due dates for state tax returns in mind. Some state tax
                  filing tools may not allow you to electronically file your
                  state tax return until your federal tax return has been
                  accepted.
